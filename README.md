# Astable Oscillator Circuit 
There are many explanations online, [this one][1] is as good as any. A good question to ask yourself is - why does it oscilate?

I was curious how small I can go. On this board traces are 25mil. I found that this is already rather small and fiddly for the through hole components. Perhaps I'd just stop here. With signal traces I can probably go as low as 6-12mil, but physical size of not SMD component just keeps the board rather large.

Connectors are [JST-XHP][2], the rest is from [AliExpress][3]. Note that this is technically is a two layers PCB, there is a air-wire between C1 and Q1. I used a cut off resistor leg to make a bridge on the top level.
